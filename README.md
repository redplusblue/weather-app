## [Click to open](https://redplusblue.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features:
1. Provides real-time weather information including but not limited to temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, visibility alongwith a forecast for the next 3-4 days. 
2. Can check the weather for [any*](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/) city by searching its name.
3. Can also fetch the weather for your precise current location.

## What I used/learned:
1. JS: callbacks, promises, Asynchronous functions, async/await, fetch, .then()
2. CSS: Multiple animations

<br>

### What I did well (I think): 
1. Code is clean and modularized.
2. Webpage is aligned and styled proportionately.
3. Number of API calls (To the weather service) Are minimized.

### What I could've done better (Working on it...):
1. The size of the app ~ 1 MB, not the best for cross platform and cross network stability, but I anticipate that it wont ruin the experience for the average viewer.
2. Compatibility for mobile phones
